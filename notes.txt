This file simply contains some of the notes for my project. 

Thoughts for hypothesis #1:
Are states that have more craft breweries more likely to support Hillary Clinton?

-I need to get the number of breweries per state. 
-I need to get the number percentage of which state voted for Trump/Clinton
-I need to build a scatter plot with the number of breweries / % who voted for Clinton

--Probably best to build a Data frame off the two CSV files then merge it into one dataframe.
